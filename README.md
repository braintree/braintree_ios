Welcome to Braintree's iOS SDK. This library will help you accept card and alternative payments in your iOS app.

v5 is the latest major version of Braintree iOS. To update from v4, see the [v5 migration guide](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/blob/master/V5_MIGRATION.md).

**The Braintree iOS SDK requires Xcode 12+**. It permits a Deployment Target of iOS 12.0 or higher.

## Supported Payment Methods

- [Credit Cards](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/credit-cards/overview)
- [PayPal](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/paypal/overview)
- [Pay with Venmo](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/venmo/overview)
- [Apple Pay](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/apple-pay/overview)
- [ThreeDSecure](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/3d-secure/overview)
- [Visa Checkout](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/visa-checkout/overview)

## Installation

We recommend using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods), or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to integrate the Braintree SDK with your project.

### Swift Package Manager
_This feature is only available in v5._

See our [Swift Package Manager guide](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/blob/master/SWIFT_PACKAGE_MANAGER.md) for instructions on integrating with SPM.

### CocoaPods
```
# Includes Cards and PayPal
pod 'Braintree'

# Optionally include additional Pods
pod 'Braintree/DataCollector'
pod 'Braintree/Venmo'
```

*Note:* If you are using version 4.x.x of the Braintree iOS SDK in Xcode 12, you may see the warning `The iOS Simulator deployment target is set to 8.0, but the range of supported deployment target versions is 9.0 to 14.0.99`. This will not prevent your app from compiling. This is a [CocoaPods issue](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7314) with a known workaround.

### Carthage
Add `github "braintree/braintree_ios"` to your `Cartfile`, and [add the frameworks to your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

*Note:* Long term support for Carthage is not guaranteed. Please update to SPM, if possible. Open a GitHub issue if there are concerns.
