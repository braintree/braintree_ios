Welcome to Braintree's iOS SDK. This library will help you accept card and alternative payments in your iOS app.

v5 is the latest major version of Braintree iOS. To update from v4, see the [v5 migration guide](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/blob/master/V5_MIGRATION.md).

**The Braintree iOS SDK permits a deployment target of iOS 12.0 or higher**. It requires Xcode 12+ and Swift 5.1+.

## Supported Payment Methods

- [Credit Cards](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/credit-cards/overview)
- [PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/paypal/overview)
- [Pay with Venmo](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/venmo/overview)
- [Apple Pay](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/apple-pay/overview)
- [ThreeDSecure](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/3d-secure/overview)
- [Visa Checkout](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/secure-remote-commerce/overview)

## Installation

We recommend using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods), or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to integrate the Braintree SDK with your project.

### Swift Package Manager
_This feature is only available in v5._

To add the `Braintree` package to your Xcode project, select _File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency_ and enter `https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios` as the repository URL. Tick the checkboxes for the specific Braintree libraries you wish to include.

If you look at your app target, you will see that the Braintree libraries you chose are automatically linked as a frameworks to your app (see _General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content_).

*`BraintreePayPal` and `BraintreePaymentFlow` also require the inclusion of the `PayPalDataCollector` module.*

In your app's source code files, use the following import syntax to include Braintree's libraries:
```
import BraintreeCore
import BraintreeCard
import BraintreeApplePay
import BraintreePayPal
```

**Braintree 5.4.2+ requires Xcode 12.5+ for SPM.** We recommend using the latest version for the simplest SPM integration. If using Braintree 5.4.1 and below, please see our [Swift Package Manager guide](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/blob/master/SWIFT_PACKAGE_MANAGER.md) for specific workarounds required to use these older versions.


### CocoaPods
```
# Includes Cards and PayPal
pod 'Braintree'

# Optionally include additional Pods
pod 'Braintree/DataCollector'
pod 'Braintree/Venmo'
```

*Note:* If you are using version 4.x.x of the Braintree iOS SDK in Xcode 12, you may see the warning `The iOS Simulator deployment target is set to 8.0, but the range of supported deployment target versions is 9.0 to 14.0.99`. This will not prevent your app from compiling. This is a [CocoaPods issue](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7314) with a known workaround.

### Carthage
Add `github "braintree/braintree_ios"` to your `Cartfile`, and [add the frameworks to your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

*Note:* Long term support for Carthage is not guaranteed. Please update to SPM, if possible. If there are concerns, please comment on [this Discussion thread](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/discussions/705).
