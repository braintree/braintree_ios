Welcome to Braintree's iOS SDK. This library will help you accept card and alternative payments in your iOS app.

A new major version of the SDK is available in beta. See the [v5 migration guide](/V5_MIGRATION.md) for details.

**The Braintree iOS SDK requires Xcode 11+**. It permits a Deployment Target of iOS 8.0 or higher.

## Supported Payment Methods

- [Credit Cards](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/credit-cards/overview)
- [PayPal](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/paypal/overview)
- [Pay with Venmo](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/venmo/overview)
- [Apple Pay](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/apple-pay/overview)
- [ThreeDSecure](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/3d-secure/overview)
- [Visa Checkout](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/visa-checkout/overview)

## Installation

We recommend using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods), or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to integrate the Braintree SDK with your project.

### Swift Package Manager (v5 Beta)
_This feature is only available in v5.0.0-beta1._

To add the `Braintree` package to your Xcode project, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter `https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios` as the repository URL. Tick the checkboxes for the specific Braintree libraries you wish to include.

If you look at your app target, you will see that the Braintree libraries you chose are automatically linked as a frameworks to your app (see General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content).

In your app's source code files, use the following import syntax to include Braintree's libraries. For example:
```
import BraintreeCore
import BraintreeCard
import BraintreeApplePay
import BraintreePayPal
```

The following Braintree libraries offer official Swift Package Manager support:
* `BraintreeAmericanExpress`
* `BraintreeApplePay`
* `BraintreeCard`
* `BraintreeCore`
* `BraintreeDataCollector`
* `BraintreePaymentFlow`
* `BraintreePayPal`
* `BraintreeThreeDSecure` **
* `BraintreeUnionPay`
* `BraintreeVenmo`
* `PayPalDataCollector`

** - To use the the `BraintreeThreeDSecure` library via SPM, you must [manually include](#manually-including-a-framework) the `CardinalMobile.framework` located in the `Frameworks` dir.

#### Manually including a framework

1. Drag and drop the framework from Finder into your Xcode project
    * Select _Copy items if needed_
    * Click _Finish_. 
        The result should look like:
        <br/><br/>
        ![image](image_assets/include_frameworks_in_proj.png)
1. Open your project's settings by selecting your app target in the General tab
    * Under the _Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content_ section, make sure each framework is set to “Embed & Sign”
    ![image](image_assets/link_libraries.png)
1. Go to the Build Phases tab. Under _Link Binary With Libraries_, make sure the frameworks are listed. This should be taken care of by step #2 above, but if not, add the frameworks manually via the `+` button.

### CocoaPods
```
# Includes Cards and PayPal
pod 'Braintree'

# Optionally include additional Pods
pod 'Braintree/DataCollector'
pod 'Braintree/Venmo'
```

*Note:* If you are using version 4.x.x of the Braintree iOS SDK in Xcode 12, you may see the warning `The iOS Simulator deployment target is set to 8.0, but the range of supported deployment target versions is 9.0 to 14.0.99`. This will not prevent your app from compiling. This is a [CocoaPods issue](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7314) with a known workaround.

### Carthage
Add `github "braintree/braintree_ios"` to your `Cartfile`, and [add the frameworks to your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

*Note:* Long term support for Carthage is not guaranteed. Please update to SPM, if possible. Open a GitHub issue if there are concerns.
