# Braintree iOS/OS X SDK

The iOS SDK provides developers with a collection of easy-to-use APIs for adding native payments to their iOS application. It has three components:

## Requirements

The Braintree iOS SDK and Venmo Touch require iOS 5.0.0 or higher. Currently, Venmo Touch is available for US customers only.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with with <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">Cocoapods</a>.

```
# Add this line to your Podspec
pod 'Braintree', :git => 'https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios.git'
```

## Sample Application

Included in this repository is a sample checkout application at `braintree/SampleCheckout`, which you may run against a sample merchant provided by Braintree on Heroku, or against a local server (code also provided in this repository).

Checkout `braintree/SampleCheckout/README.md` for more details on running the sample application.

## Components

* [Venmo Touch](https://www.braintreepayments.com/docs/ios/venmo_touch/overview), a one-tap purchasing network enabling your users to make in-app purchases without typing in their credit card details. 
* The [payment form](https://www.braintreepayments.com/docs/ios/payment_form/overview): A beautiful, polished credit card entry form complete with built-in validations, ready for you to drop into your app.
* [Encryption](https://www.braintreepayments.com/docs/ios/encryption/overview): Client-side encryption allowing you to encrypt credit card data before sending it to your servers and on to the Braintree gateway, making PCI compliance a breeze.

These components are designed to work together, but can be used independently of each other. For example, you could use Venmo Touch and client-side encryption without using the prebuilt payment form.
On OS X, you need to implement a custom payment form and follow the [Encryption](https://www.braintreepayments.com/docs/ios/encryption/overview) guidelines.

## Documentation
