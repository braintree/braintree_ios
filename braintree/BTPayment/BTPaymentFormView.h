 ******************************
 *
 * UIView containing a form users can use to manually enter credit card information, including:
 *    - card number
 *    - expiration date
 *    - security code
 *    - zipcode (optionally)
 *
 * The UIView presents all the card input fields in a single line, so the entire view only
 * requires 40 px of vertical space.
 *
 * Hint images show the correct card logo after the user enters the first ~2 characters of
 * her card number. Then, the hint images animate to show where the user can find the
 * security code when she focuses on the security code field (3 digits on back
 * of card in most cases, 4 digits on front of card for Amex).
 *
 * Also based on the card type, spacing of the card numbers adjusts to match the spacing
 * on the card, making it easier for a user to keep her place as they look back and forth
 * from her physical card to the input form.
 * (eg. Amex: 1234 123456 12345, Others: 1234 5678 9012 3456).
 *
 * Validation on all fields happens as the user enters her information, catching errors
 * before the user submits the form to the server, saving slow/expensive round trips in the
 * event where a user mis-types information. Validations include:
 *    - Luhn algorithm to validate card number (15 digits for Amex, 16 digits for others, and
 *      valid checksum in all cases)
 *    - Expiration date cannot be in past
 *    - Security code must be 4 digits for Amex, 3 digits for others
 *
 * BTPaymentFormView is a subclass of UIView, so you may use any methods on UIView to achieve
 * specific styling (like backgroundColor, borderWidth, etc).
