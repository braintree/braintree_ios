 *
 * Drop in screen to handle input of card information by users of your app. This
 * view controller reduces the number of delegate methods you need to implement and UIView
 * components you need to display.
 *
 * BTPaymentViewController contains the BTPaymentFormView and can be used with or without
 * Venmo Touch. If Venmo Touch is enabled, the BTPaymentViewController will also contain a
 * VTCardView and VTCheckboxView.
 *
 * If Venmo Touch is enabled, the VTCardView and VTCheckboxView will be created for you.
 *
 * When using BTPaymentViewController, you must implement the two delegate methods
 * of BTPaymentViewControllerDelegate with Venmo Touch enabled. Without Venmo Touch,
 * you must implement only the first delegate method:
 *    - (void)paymentViewController:(BTPaymentViewController *)paymentViewController didSubmitCardWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)cardInfo andCardInfoEncrypted:(NSDictionary *)cardInfoEncrypted // Required
 *    - (void)paymentViewController:(BTPaymentViewController *)paymentViewController didAuthorizeCardWithPaymentMethodCode:(NSString *)paymentMethodCode  // Venmo Touch Only
 *
 * (See below for details on these two delegate methods).
 *
 * After a user successfully adds a card, it is the developer's
 * job to dismiss this BTPaymentViewConroller (e.g. by dismissing it modally).
 * Before doing so, please call `prepareForDismissal`.
 *
 * Right before a delegate method is triggered, the BTPaymentViewController will display
 * a "loading overlay" that blocks the UI (a BTPaymentActivityOverlayView). While the loading
 * overlay is being displayed, we recommend that you send the delegate method's payload (either
 * a "paymentMethodCode" or a "cardInfo" dictionary) to your server. Once your server returns
 * to the client with a response, you may dismiss the loading overlay.
 *
 * If a user manually enters a card, we recommend you vault the card before dismissing
 * the BTPaymentViewController, because vaulting the card will perform additional
 * validations, like ensuring the security code is correct, AVS/Zipcode validation passes
 * (if you have enabled this feature), and the card has not been blacklisted. In the
 * event that the security code or AVS validation fails, you'll want to display an
 * error message to the user asking them to change these fields, which is why we recommend
 * leaving the BTPaymentViewController visible until you have submitted the card successfully
 * to the gateway.
 *
 * If there is a server side error, eg, from the Braintree Gateway create credit card
 * endpoint, we recommend you forward that error message back to your iOS app and display
 * the error message to the end user with "showErrorWithTitle:message:". That will display the
 * error to the user (as well as dismiss the loading overlay) so that the user can modify
 * her input and verify her card again.
