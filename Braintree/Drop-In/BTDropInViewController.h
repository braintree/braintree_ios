/// When initialized with a Braintree client, the Drop In will prompt a user for payment details,
/// based on your Gatweay configuration. The Drop In payment form supports cards and PayPal. When
/// using Drop In, you don't need to worry about which methods are already on file with Braintree;
/// newly created methods are saved as part of the Drop In flow as needed.
///
/// Upon successful form submission, you will receive a payment method nonce, which you can
/// transact with on your server. Client and validation errors are handled internally by Drop In;
/// other types of Errors are rare and generally irrecoverable.

/// The Drop In view controller delegates presentation and dismissal to the developer. It has been
/// most thoroughly tested in the context of a UINavigationController.
///
/// The Drop In can send success and cancelation messages to the developer via the
/// delegate. See `delegate` and `BTDropInViewControllerDelegate`.

/// You can customize Drop In in various ways, for example, you can change the primary Call To
/// Action button text. For visual customzation options see `theme` and `BTUI`. Like any
/// UIViewController, you can setup properties like `title` or `navigationBar.rightBarButtonItem`.
