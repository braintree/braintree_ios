# Braintree iOS v5 Migration Guide

See the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes. This migration guide outlines the basics for updating your client integration from v4 to v5.

v5 introduces support for Swift Package Manager. See the [Swift Package Manager guide](/SWIFT_PACKAGE_MANAGER.md) for more details.

_Documentation for v5 will be published to https://developers.braintreepayments.com once it is available for general release._

## Supported Versions

v5 supports a minimum deployment target of iOS 12+. It requires the use of Xcode 12+ and Swift 5.1+. If your application contains Objective-C code, the `Enable Modules` build setting must be set to `YES`.

## App Context Switching

v5 renames the `BTAppSwitch` class to `BTAppContextSwitcher` to clarify that it is used for flows that requiring switching contexts, either by opening an `SFSafariViewController` or by opening a different app (specifically, Venmo).

`BTAppSwitchDelegate` was removed in v5. If you were using these delegate methods to determine when control switched between your app and the Venmo app, we recommend using app or scene delegate methods instead. If you were using `BTAppSwitchDelegate` to determine when an `SFSafariViewController` was presented or dismissed, we recommend using the `BTViewControllerPresentingDelegate` methods instead.

Register your app's custom URL scheme with `BTAppContextSwitcher` in your app delegate:
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
  BTAppContextSwitcher.setReturnURLScheme("com.your-company.your-app.payments")
  return true
}
```

If you're using `UISceneDelegate`, use the following code to pass a return URL to `BTAppContextSwitcher`:

```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, openURLContexts URLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {
  URLContexts.forEach { context in
    if context.url.scheme?.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare("com.your-company.your-app.payments") == .orderedSame {
      BTAppContextSwitcher.handleOpenURLContext(urlContext)
    }
  }
}
```

If you aren't using `UISceneDelegate`, you will need to update the `handleOpenURL` method you call from within the `application:OpenURL:options` app delegate method. Note that v5 removes the `options` and `sourceApplication` params.

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    if url.scheme?.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare("com.your-company.your-app.payments") == .orderedSame {
        return BTAppContextSwitcher.handleOpenURL(url)
    }
    return false
}
```

## 3D Secure

In v4, 3D Secure classes were housed in the `BraintreePaymentFlow` module. In v5, `BraintreeThreeDSecure` is a standalone module offering the same 3DS functionality. The `BraintreePaymentFlow` module still houses Local Payment functionality.

#### Integration

##### CocoaPods

In your Podfile, add:
```
pod `Braintree/ThreeDSecure`
```

##### Carthage

You will need to add the `BraintreeThreeDSecure` framework to your project. See the Carthage docs for [integration instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

*Note:* Long term support for Carthage is not guaranteed. Please update to SPM, if possible. Open a GitHub issue if there are concerns.

##### Swift Package Manager

Include `BraintreeThreeDSecure` and `CardinalMobile`. [See the Swift Package Manager guide](/SWIFT_PACKAGE_MANAGER.md) for additional instructions.

#### BTThreeDSecureRequestDelegate

The signature for the `BTThreeDSecureRequestDelegate` method `onLookupComplete` has changed:

```swift
public func onLookupComplete(_ request: BTThreeDSecureRequest, lookupResult result: BTThreeDSecureResult, next: @escaping () -> Void) {

}
```
The lookup information, such as `requiresUserAuthentication`, can be found on the result's `lookup` property:

```swift
result.lookup?.requiresUserAuthentication
```

#### 3DS2 UI Customization

On `BTThreeDSecureRequest`, the `uiCustomization` property was replaced with `v2UICustomization` of type `BTThreeDSecureV2UICustomization`. For 3DS2 UI customization, use the following new classes:

* `BTThreeDSecureV2UICustomization`
* `BTThreeDSecureV2ButtonCustomization`
* `BTThreeDSecureV2LabelCustomization`
* `BTThreeDSecureV2TextBoxCustomization`
* `BTThreeDSecureV2ToolbarCustomization`

#### Default 3DS Version

Previously, the `versionRequested` property on `BTThreeDSecureRequest` defaulted to `.version1`. It now defaults to `.version2`.

#### Shipping Method

The `shippingMethod` property on `BTThreeDSecureRequest` is now an enum rather than a string. Possible values:
* `.sameDay`
* `.expedited`
* `.priority`
* `.ground`
* `.electronicDelivery`
* `.shipToStore`

## Apple Pay

For CocoaPods integrations, the Braintree Apple Pay subspec has been renamed from `Braintree/Apple-Pay` to `Braintree/ApplePay`.

## Card

v5 removes the `initWithParameters` and `initWithNumber` initializers from `BTCard`. To construct a `BTCard`, set the properties directly:

```
let card = BTCard()
card.number = "4111111111111111"
card.expirationMonth = "12"
card.expirationYear = "2025"
card.cvv = "123"
```

## Data Collector

v5 removes the `BTDataCollector.collectCardFraudData()` method. You should instead use `BTDataCollector.collectDeviceData()` which will collect Kount data if your merchant account is properly setup for a Kount integration.

v5 also removes the `BTDataCollectorDelegate`. You should call `collectDeviceData()` as early as possible, e.g. at app launch. If that's too early, calling it when the customer initiates checkout is also fine.

## PayPal

#### Custom URL Scheme

Registering a custom URL scheme in your Xcode project is no longer required for the PayPal flow.

Code previously used to set your return URL scheme can be deleted. **Note:** This only applies to the PayPal flow. Other payment methods (ex: Venmo, Local Payment Methods, 3DS) still require a custom URL scheme.
```
BTAppSwitch.setReturnURLScheme("com.your-company.your-app.payments")
```

#### PayPal Request

v5 introduces two subclasses of `BTPayPalRequest`: 
* `BTPayPalCheckoutRequest`, for checkout flows
* `BTPayPalVaultRequest`, for vault flows. 

The `requestOneTimePayment` and `requestBillingAgreement` methods on `BTPayPalDriver` have been updated to expect instances of `BTPayPalCheckoutRequest` and `BTPayPalVaultRequest`, respectively.

However, `requestOneTimePayment` and `requestBillingAgreement` have been deprecated in favor of `tokenizePayPalAccount`:

```swift
let request = BTPayPalCheckoutRequest(amount: "10.00")
payPalDriver.tokenizePayPalAccount(with: request) { nonce, error in
  // handle errors or send nonce to server to transact
}

```

If your app supports multi-tasking, you must set the `BTPayPalRequest.activeWindow` property to ensure that the PayPal flow launches from the correct window.

For PayPal Checkout flows, the `offerCredit` property has been removed in favor of `offerPayLater`.

#### Other Changes

Implementing the `BTViewControllerPresentingDelegate` is no longer required for the PayPal flow.

## Venmo

The `authorizeAccount` methods on `BTVenmoDriver` have been replaced with a `tokenizeVenmoAccount` method.

```
let venmoRequest = BTVenmoRequest()
venmoRequest.profileID = "my-profile-id"
venmoRequest.vault = true

venmoDriver.tokenizeVenmoAccount(with: venmoRequest) { (venmoAccountNonce, error) -> Void in
  if (error != nil) {
    // handle error
  }

  // transact with nonce on server
}
```
