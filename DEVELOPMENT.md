# Braintree iOS Development Notes

This document outlines development practices that we follow while developing this SDK.

## Development Merchant Server

The included demo app utilizes a [sandbox sample merchant server](https://braintree-sample-merchant.herokuapp.com) hosted on Heroku.

## Tests

Each module has a corresponding unit test target. These can be run individually, or all at once via the `UnitTests` scheme.

To run the tests:
1. Fetch test dependencies
    * `pod install`
1. Run tests
    * `xcodebuild test -workspace Braintree.xcworkspace -scheme UnitTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'`
    * **OR** via the Xcode UI by selecting the `UnitTests` scheme + `âŒ˜U`

_Note:_ Running the `UI` and `IntegrationTests` schemes follows the same steps as above, just replacing the `UnitTests` scheme name in step 3.

## Releasing

Refer to the `ios/releases` section in the internal SDK Knowledge Repo.
