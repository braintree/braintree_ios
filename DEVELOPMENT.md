# Braintree iOS Development Notes

This document outlines development practices that we follow while developing this SDK.

## Development Merchant Server

The included demo app utilizes a [sandbox sample merchant server](https://braintree-sample-merchant.herokuapp.com) hosted on Heroku.

## Tests

Each module has a corresponding unit test target. These can be run individually, or all at once via the `UnitTests` scheme.

To run the tests:
1. Fetch test dependencies
    * `pod install`
1. Run tests
    * `xcodebuild test -workspace Braintree.xcworkspace -scheme UnitTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'`
    * **OR** via the Xcode UI by selecting the `UnitTests` scheme + `âŒ˜U`

_Note:_ Running the `UI` and `IntegrationTests` schemes follows the same steps as above, just replacing the `UnitTests` scheme name in step 3.

## Importing Header Files

### Importing a Swift module into Obj-C

To import a Braintree framework written in **Swift** into an Objective-C file, use the following syntax:
```objc
#if __has_include(<Braintree/Braintree-Swift.h>) // CocoaPods
#import <Braintree/Braintree-Swift.h>

#elif __has_include("Braintree-Swift.h")         // CocoaPods for ReactNative
/* Use quoted style when importing Swift headers for ReactNative support
 * See https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/issues/671
 */
#import "Braintree-Swift.h"

#elif SWIFT_PACKAGE                              // SPM
/* Use @import for SPM support
 * See https://forums.swift.org/t/using-a-swift-package-in-a-mixed-swift-and-objective-c-project/27348
 */
@import BraintreeCore;

#else                                            // Carthage
#import <BraintreeCore/BraintreeCore-Swift.h>
#endif
```
