# Braintree iOS Development Notes

This document outlines development practices that we follow while developing this SDK.

## Development Merchant Server

The included demo app utilizes a [sandbox sample merchant server](https://braintree-sample-merchant.herokuapp.com) hosted on Heroku.

## Tests

Each module has a corresponding unit test target. These can be run individually, or all at once via the `UnitTests` scheme.

To run the tests:
1. Fetch test dependencies
    * `pod install`
1. Fetch PayPal Checkout SPM package
    * `swift package resolve`
    * **OR** via the Xcode UI "File" > "Packages" > "Resolve Package Versions"
1. Run tests
    * `xcodebuild test -workspace Braintree.xcworkspace -scheme UnitTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'`
    * **OR** via the Xcode UI by selecting the `UnitTests` scheme + `âŒ˜U`

_Note:_ Running the `UI` and `IntegrationTests` schemes follows the same steps as above, just replacing the `UnitTests` scheme name in step 3.

## Importing Header Files

To maintain support for CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager, and Carthage, our Objective-C import statements need specific attention.

While SPM, Carthage, and manual integrations use the same import style (`#import <BraintreeCore/BraintreeCore.h>`), CocoaPods requires a different syntax (`#import <Braintree/BraintreeCore.h>`). This is because CocoaPods creates a single Braintree framework out of the subspecs the merchant includes, whereas SPM, Carthage, and manual integrations treat each module as a separate framework, i.e., BraintreeCore, BraintreeCard, etc.

Public headers for each module must live in the directory `Public/<MODULE_NAME>`. This allows SPM to use the same import syntax as Carthage (e.g., `<BraintreeCore/BraintreCore.h>`).

We use if-else preprocessor directives to satisfy each dependency manager. See the below example for importing a **public header file**.

```objc
#if __has_include(<Braintree/BraintreeCore.h>) // CocoaPods
#import <Braintree/BraintreeCore.h>
#else // SPM or Carthage
#import <BraintreeCore/BraintreeCore.h>
#endif
```

### Importing internal headers

In general, we avoid importing **internal headers from other modules**, but occasionally it's necessary. See the below example for importing an internal header file from another module:
```objc
#if __has_include(<Braintree/BraintreeAmericanExpress.h>) // CocoaPods
#import <Braintree/BTAPIClient_Internal.h>

#elif SWIFT_PACKAGE // SPM
#import "../BraintreeCore/BTAPIClient_Internal.h"

#else // Carthage
#import <BraintreeCore/BTAPIClient_Internal.h>
#endif
```

### Importing a Swift module into Obj-C

To import a Braintree framework written in **Swift** into an Objective-C file, use the following syntax:
```objc
#if __has_include(<Braintree/Braintree-Swift.h>) // CocoaPods
#import <Braintree/Braintree-Swift.h>

#elif __has_include("Braintree-Swift.h")         // CocoaPods for ReactNative
/* Use quoted style when importing Swift headers for ReactNative support
 * See https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/issues/671
 */
#import "Braintree-Swift.h"

#elif SWIFT_PACKAGE                              // SPM
/* Use @import for SPM support
 * See https://forums.swift.org/t/using-a-swift-package-in-a-mixed-swift-and-objective-c-project/27348
 */
@import PayPalDataCollector;

#else                                            // Carthage
#import <PayPalDataCollector/PayPalDataCollector-Swift.h>
#endif
```
