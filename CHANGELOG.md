You should delete it from your project and add `CardinalMobile` via SPM. If you added the run script to remove simulator architectures from `CardinalMobile.framework`, you should remove this as well. See the [Swift Package Manager guide](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/blob/5.x/SWIFT_PACKAGE_MANAGER.md) for more information.

* APIs have been refactored to use completion blocks instead of delegate methods.
* BTPaymentProvider has been removed. Instead, use payment option frameworks. For example, import BraintreeApplePay and use BTApplePayClient.

* All methods and properties have been updated with nullability annotations.
* Added support for Carthage in addition to CocoaPods.

* Added support for PayPal billing agreements (the New Vault Flow) and one-time payments.
* Drop-in is now part of the new BraintreeUI framework. BraintreeUI has been refactored for greater flexibility; it will automatically exclude any payment options that are not included in your build (as determined by CocoaPods subspecs or Carthage frameworks).
* Venmo One Touch has been excluded from this version. To join the beta for Pay with Venmo, contact Braintree Support.
* BTData has been renamed to BTDataCollector.
* BTPaymentMethod has been renamed to BTPaymentMethodNonce.

* Fix bug in Demo app

* Fix bug with PayPal app switching
  * The bug occurred when installing a new app after the Braintree SDK had been initialized. When attempting to authorize with PayPal in this scenario, the SDK would switch to the `wallet` and launch the `in-app` authorization.

## 3.8.1 (2015-05-22)

* 3D Secure only: :rotating_light: Breaking API Changes for 3D Secure :rotating_light:
  * Fix a bug in native mobile 3D Secure that, in some cases, prevented access to the new nonce.
  * Your delegate will now receive `-paymentMethodCreator:didCreatePaymentMethod:` even when liability shift is not possible and/or liability was not shifted.
  * You must check `threeDSecureInfo` to determine whether liability shift is possible and liability was shifted. This property is now of type `BTThreeDSecureInfo`. Example:

```objectivec
- (void)paymentMethodCreator:(__unused id)sender didCreatePaymentMethod:(BTPaymentMethod *)paymentMethod {

    if ([paymentMethod isKindOfClass:[BTCardPaymentMethod class]]) {
        BTCardPaymentMethod *cardPaymentMethod = (BTCardPaymentMethod *)paymentMethod;
        if (cardPaymentMethod.threeDSecureInfo.liabilityShiftPossible &&
            cardPaymentMethod.threeDSecureInfo.liabilityShifted) {

            NSLog(@"liability shift possible and liability shifted");

        } else {

            NSLog(@"3D Secure authentication was attempted but liability shift is not possible");

        }
    }
}
```

* Important: Since `cardPaymentMethod.threeDSecureInfo.liabilityShiftPossible` and `cardPaymentMethod.threeDSecureInfo.liabilityShifted` are client-side values, they should be used for UI flow only. They should not be trusted for your server-side risk assessment. To require 3D Secure in cases where the buyer's card is enrolled for 3D Secure, set the `required` option to `true` in your server integration. [See our 3D Secure docs for more details.](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/3d-secure)

## 3.8.0 (2015-05-21)

* Refactor and improve SSL Pinning code
* Update PayPal Mobile SDK to new version (PayPal-iOS-SDK 2.8.4-bt1) that does not include card.io.
  * :rotating_light: Please note! :rotating_light:  

      This change breaks builds that depend on a workaround introduced in 3.4.0 that added card.io headers to fix [card.io duplicate symbol issues](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/issues/53).

      Since card.io is not officially part of the Braintree API, and since the headers were only included as part of a workaround for use by a small group of developers, this potentially-breaking change is not accompanied by a major version release.

      If your build breaks due to this change, you can re-add card.io to your project's Podfile:

          pod 'CardIO', '~> 4.0'

      And adjust your card.io imports to:

          #import <CardIO/CardIO.h>
